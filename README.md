# iron-meta-pipeline

**What is this?** A general pipeline to generate tractography from diffusion MRI data.

**Another one??** The idea is to build a meta-pipeline able to embed the preprocessing workflow 

**Why?** Every tractography pipeline can be summerized in three steps:
1. Pre-processing/modelling:
2. Tracking:
3. Filtering:
During these steps, additional constraints and priors are used during the tracking and filtering stages.
One example of this organization is given in the supplementary materials of Maier-Hein et al. 2017, where each pipeline in the challenge is briefly described. However, given the different tools used in each case, it is difficult to reproduce those pipelines and compare them on a different dataset or with different parameters.

**How?**
